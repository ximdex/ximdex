# /* Changelog
#  * ---------- Install.sh -------------
#  * - Moved and adapted from ximtest.sh the tests to check whether apache is running. 
#  *    Needed here because if apache is not running, the subsequent commands to get the apache group will fail
#  * - Changed the command to obtain the apache group with which apache is running
#  * - Changed some commands to be compatible with other unix distributions
#  *
#  * ---------- scripts/ximtest.sh -------------
#  *
#  * ---------- scripts/ximdb.sh ---------------
#  * - Changed some commands to be compatible with other unix distributions
#  * - Added server port (setPort function)
#  * - Changed usage function and case flow to fix some issues
#  * - Changed user grant sentences in checkUser function, from user @'localhost' to user@'%' because @'localhost' doesn't make sense of the mysql server is an external server and not localhost
#  *   because of if you are going to connect with the external server from a given host, the connection will fail as the user has only permissions if connects from 'localhost'
#  * - Changed checkUserError and loadData functions to be aware of the mysql port
#  * - Changed setServer function to remove the protocol and trailing slashes (if exist) from the server given by the user before make the connection test
#  *
#  * ---------- scripts/lib/functions.sh -------
#  * - Added PORT_DB var
#  * - Changed some commands to be compatible with other unix distributions
#  * - Changed getDBParams to be aware of server port
#  * - Changed sql and sql_user functions to use the --port parameter in mysql command
#  *
#  * ---------- scripts/ximparams.sh ----------
#  * - Changed some commands to be compatible with other unix distributions
#  *
#  * ---------- scripts/ximinitialize.sh ------
#  * - Changed some commands to be compatible with other unix distributions
#  *
#  * ---------- templates/install-params.conf.php -----
#  * - Added  port to conf template
#  *
#  * ---------- templates/setup.conf ------------------
#  * - Added port (3309 by default)
#  *
#  *
#  * ---------- IMPROVEMENTS TO DO --------------------
#  * - Improve the web server checking according to the operating system where the script is running
#  * - Improve the grant command according to the server which the user is going to connect from (a new option in the ximdb script? )
#  *
