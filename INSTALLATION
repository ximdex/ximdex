Ximdex - INSTALLATION procedures
--------------------------------

Installing Ximdex is easy but not trivial. Ximdex is distributed as TAR (or TGZ) files, debian or RPM packages, Virtual machines, etc.

Before starting the installation check if you comply with the requeriments and dependencies. 
If you are directly installing from a TGZ file, after moving the code to its "natural" place (a directory served by your HTTP server, as described in Section A - PREPARATION), an installation script has to be executed in order to install&configure your Ximdex instance (as described in Section B - INSTALLATION). This "install.sh" bash script will ask you some basic parameters as mysql passwords, paths, urls, and so on. If it is your first time with Ximdex, we recommend you to install using the default projects and modules.

A note about Ximdex versions: last Ximdex version is available in Brazilian portuguese, German, English and Spanish. It can be directly downloaded from Ximdex.com or external repositories as a TGZ file. Previous versions of Ximdex are also available as debian, rpm and oracle virtual machine packages.

SECTION A - PREPARATION: preparing the instance to be installed:
---------------------------------------------------------------

  In order to prepar your Ximdex instance before installation, please choose one method from this section:


  Installing from a TGZ or TAR file (preferred method for uptodate versions):
  ---------------------------------

	If you downloaded a '.tgz' package:
    
   		1) Untar the package in your web server root folder (i.e: /var/www, /var/www/html, ...). We'll use '/var/www/'. Choose the right one for you:
			>$ cp <current_path>/ximdex-VERSION_open_rREVISION.tgz /var/www/
                        >$ cd /var/www/			
			>$ tar zxvf /var/www/ximdex-VERSION_open_rREVISION.tgz 

		  By default, your instance will be named as 'ximdex_VERSION'

		2) Continue the installation in SECTION B - INSTALLATION 


  Installing from a RPM package:
  -----------------------------

	If you downloaded a '.rpm' package:

		1) We recommend to use the package manager 'yum' to perform the installation. You can execute it in your console as follow:

			># yum install ximdex-VERSION.all.rpm

		  If you prefer not to use 'yum', you can also execute in your console:

			># rpm -ivh ximdex-VERSION.all.rpm 

		By doing this, your Ximdex root folder will be placed by default on '/var/www/html/' and it will be named as 'ximdex_VERSION'

		2) Continue the installation in SECTION B - INSTALLATION 


  Installing an Oracle Virtual Machine (OVA file):
  -----------------------------------------------

	If you downloaded a '.ova' virtual machine:
    
		1) Install Virtual Box:

			If you did not install Virtual Box:
				- Download it from http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
				- Install it (it will reboot the system) -> further information in http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html


		2) Launch Virtual Box.


		3) Import the virtual machine:

			Choose one of the following method:

			3.A) Automatic:

				Browse your filesystem and double click the '.ova' file.

			3.B) Manually:

				In the menu, select 'File' ('Archivo') and 'Import appliance' ('Importar servicio virtualizado')
     
				Press 'Select' ('Seleccionar') button and explore your file system to choose the downloaded '.ova' file

				Press 'Import' ('Importar') button to start to import the virtual machine.


		4) Launch Ximdex virtual machine:

			Once importation has finished, double click the virtual machine called 'Ximdex VERSION' on the left side, or select it and press the 'Start' ('Iniciar') button (on top).


		5) Launch Ximdex instance:

			Once virtual machine has been started, double click the direct access located in your desktop named 'Start Ximdex'. It will open your Ximdex instance in your browser.


		6) You're done. Enjoy Ximdex!


  Installing from a DEBIAN repository or package:
  ----------------------------------------------

	Debian users can use a debian package or our Debian Repository (highly recommended option for Debian Lenny users). Get your Ximdex instance from our Debian Repository as follow:

  	- DEBIAN Lenny users (installing from our debian repository):
    	  ------------------
	
		1) Add our repository to your source list open the file '/etc/apt/sources.list' as privileged user and add the line:

			deb http://ximdex.org/repository/debian binary/

		2) Update your repository list, typing in your console as privileged user:

			># apt-get update

		3) Install the package from our repository, typing in your console:

			># apt-get install ximdex

		4) Your Ximdex root folder will be placed by default on '/var/www/', as 'ximdex_VERSION'

		5) Check that your Ximdex root folder has the right user and group assignments for your apache web server. 
		   For example, if your chosen user is 'ximdex' and your Apache group is 'www-data', type in your console as root:

			># chown -R ximdex:www-data /var/www/ximdex_VERSION

		6) Installation has be automatically done by Debian. Visit the URL http://localhost/ximdex_VERSION to enjoy Ximdex!
			
			
	- Other DEBIAN users (installing from a .deb package):
	  ------------------
 
          If you downloaded a '.deb' package (This option is not recommended for Debian Lenny users, use instead our Debian Repository in the previous section)

		1) We recommend to use the package manager 'gdebi' to perform the installation. You can execute it in your console as follow:

			># gdebi ximdex-VERSION.all.deb

		   Or, if you prefer not to use 'gdebi', you can also execute:

			># dpkg -i ximdex-VERSION.all.deb 

		2) By doing this, your Ximdex root folder will be placed by default on '/var/www/' and it will be named as 'ximdex_VERSION'
    
		3) Restarting MySQL and Apache services is recommended, specially if dependant packages were installed.

		4) Continue the installation in SECTION B - INSTALLATION 




SECTION B - INSTALLATION to install and configure your Ximdex instance:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  To start this section you should have a Ximdex instance installed in a directory under your web root. Debian Lenny users of our repository and OVA installations do not have to execute this step.


  Please, follow these steps to install and configure your Ximdex instance...

  1) Move to the location of Ximdex (<ximdex_home>).

  2) Run the install script of Ximdex as a privileged user (it is important to run it from the <ximdex_home>): 

		 >$ sudo bash ./install/install.sh


  3) Follow the installation instructions and fill the requested data:

	3.1) Set the MySQL server url. By default, 'localhost'.

		>$ Database server [localhost]:

	3.2) Set the MySQL Admin user name. By default, 'root'.

		>$ Admin database user [root]:

	3.3) Set the MySQL Admin user password. Password should be typed twice.

		>$ Admin database password:
		>$ Admin database password (repeat):

	3.4) Set the database name to load all the Ximdex data. By default, 'ximdex'. If provided database already exists, the system will ask if you want to overwrite it, use it, or provide a new one.
